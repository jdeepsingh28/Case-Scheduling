CWRU Scheduling Planner Users Manual

Starting the application

Have all the code from the GitHub repository on your machine
cd into the outer myproject directory on the terminal
run the command “python manage.py runserver”
Make sure you have all the necessary pip installs (django, bs4, requests)

This will start the development server. You now need to copy and paste the link returned in the terminal into a browser window.

In this case, the link would be http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

This will take you to our login page. You want to click the Create New Account button and input some information so that you have an account on the site. After that, use the username and password you input to log in on the login page. 
This will take you to the home page. Since we do not have any majors other than computer science currently working, click the submit button for computer science

You will now see a list of all the possible classes that can be taken within the computer science department for CWRU as well as all the required classes for the computer science major and engineering department.

At the bottom of this page, you will find the Create Random Schedule button. This button allows users who have no idea what they want to take and do not have credit for any classes to have a random schedule that meets all the CWRU graduation requirements output for them. 

For most users, however, we have functionalities to customize to each specific user. Users can select classes that they have already taken/have credit for from APs. The classes that are selected as taken will not be put into the schedule but will count toward meeting the requirements. For example, if you list a breadth class as being taken, it will only put one other class from that breadth area into the schedule because it will still satisfy the graduation requirement. We also have the level of interest radio button that enables users to select classes that they are interested in. As long as it enables them to complete graduation requirements, we add those courses to the schedule in place of others. 

Once you have added the proper taken and interest selections, click the Create Schedule button at the bottom of the page and you will be taken to the schedule page where your classes are split into semesters. This page enables you to move the classes around to different semesters through the move up, move down, and move to any semester buttons. The move down and move up buttons move selected classes up or down one semester and the move to any semester function will move selected classes to the semester that is displayed in the drop-down. 

Once you are happy with your schedule, you can save it using the save schedule button. You could also view previously saved schedules using the view saved schedules button. 

Once a schedule has been saved, it will be displayed on the saved schedules page. This page enables you to edit any previous schedule that you have saved as well. Simply click on the edit schedule button for the schedule that you want to edit and perform edits in the same manner as described before. Once you are happy with your schedule, you can save it again and it will be visible in the saved schedules page in its newly edited format. 

At any point, if you want to return to the home page, just click the home button and it will take you back to the home page.
